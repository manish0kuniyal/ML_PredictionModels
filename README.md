## REGRESSION
Helps us to predict a dependent output variable based on the values of independent input variable
## LINEAR REGRESSION
finds the relation between input and output variable  by plotting a line which best fits the data given to it
equation which is used to predict that is a straight line equation.

| x   |  y |
|-----|----|
| 140 | 20 |             
| 150 | 40 |
| 160 | 30 |
| 170 | 55 |

 what will be the value at 165- ?  by drawing a line of best fit through the data point we can actually predict the value at 165
 
## LOGISTIC REGRESSION
predicts value of output based on input it's output is 0 or 1 (YES OR NO).
